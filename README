Binarypool is a REST web service that handles generation of thumbnails
(renditions) for images. Clients can upload images, binarypool generates all
renditions based on configuration on the server and then stores the original
file along with the renditions.

Each binary gets accompanied with an asset file which allows consumers to
retrieve information about binaries and easily use the renditions on frontend
sites.

Binaries can be storied either in the local file system or on Amazon S3.
