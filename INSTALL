The following steps are required to set up binarypool:

    1. Get code
    2. Configuration
    3. Set up web
    4. Run tests
    5. Set up cronjobs


1. Get code
===========
Binarypool builds on top of Okapi. You need to check out Okapi and the
logging extension:

  $ cd inc && svn co https://svn.liip.ch/repos/public/okapi/core/trunk/inc/api
  $ cd ../ext && svn co https://svn.liip.ch/repos/public/okapi/ext/log/trunk/inc log


2. Configuration
================
Copy conf/binarypool.php-dist to conf/binarypool.php. That file contains
information about the buckets and some file paths.

Then copy conf/config.d/default.yml-dist to conf/config.d/default.yml-dist.
The only interesting configuration to change in that file is the logging
path and verbosity.


3. Set up web
=============
Set up the web in Apache or your web server of choice. In case you're not
running on Apache, you must migrate the rewrite rules from .htaccess
manually.


4. Run tests
============
To verify that your configuration is correct and you have all the required
settings, you can run the test suite:

  $ tests/run_all.sh


5. Set up cronjob
=================
The script scripts/expire.php deletes expired items in the binarypool.
You should set it to run daily using cron.
