The following steps are required to set up binarypool:

    1. Configuration
    2. Set up web
    3. Set up cronjobs


1. Configuration
================
Copy conf/binarypool.php-dist to conf/binarypool.php. That file contains
information about the buckets and some file paths.


2. Set up web
=============
Set up the web in Apache or your web server of choice. In case you're not
running on Apache, you must migrate the rewrite rules from .htaccess
manually.


3. Set up cronjob
=================
The script scripts/expire.php deletes expired items in the binarypool.
You should set it to run daily using cron.
