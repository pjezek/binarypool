    <h2>Parameters</h2>
    <p>The path is the asset file name as returned by the
    <a href="cmd_create.html">create new binary command</a>.</p>

    <h2>Response</h2>
    <p>HTTP Code 204 is returned if the file was deleted. The body does not contain any content.</p>
    
    <h2>Warning</h2>
    <p>This method is activated on a per-bucket basis. Deletions are only
    possible if explicitly activated for a bucket. You should not use that
    feature in production. Instead let <a href="expiration.html">the
    expiration magic</a> do it's work.</p>
