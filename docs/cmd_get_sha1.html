    <h1>Get asset by SHA1 hash</h1>
    
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Path</th>
            <td>/{bucket}/sha1/{hash}</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>HTTP Method</th>
            <td>GET, HEAD</td>

        <tr>
            <th>Description</th>
            <td>Returns asset file by the SHA1 hash of the original picture.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>This command is mostly used for content creators to find out if a
    binary already exists. For that a client can compute the SHA1 hash of the
    picture and do a HEAD request to this view.</p>
    
    <h2>Response</h2>
    <p>HTTP Code 302 is returned if the file exists. A 404 error is returned
    otherwise.</p>
    
    <p>The header X-Asset contains the asset file name.</p>
    
    <p><em>Implementation note</em>: The Location header could not be used
    because it would have to be absolute. But asset file names are relative to
    the binary pool root.</p>
