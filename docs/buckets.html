    <h1>Buckets</h1>
    
    <p>The Binary Pool service is based around the notion of buckets. The
    first directory part of any URL on the binary pool is a bucket. Each
    bucket can define its own renditions which are automatically generated
    when creating a new binary in that bucket.</p>

    <h2>Defined buckets</h2>
    <p>To get a list of all defined buckets use the
    <a href="cmd_list_buckets.html">List buckets</a> command.</p>
    
    <h2>Creating New Buckets</h2>
    <p>To create a new bucket follow these steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Update <tt>conf/binarypool.php</tt> with the definition of the
            bucket.</li>
        <li>Create a directory under <tt>$ROOT</tt> with the same name as the
            bucket. Make sure the web server has permission to write to that
            directory.</li>
    </ol>
