            <td>Enum</td>
            <td>Type of the upload. This value influences the rendition
            generation. See the list below (Types) for valid types.</td>

            <td>URL</td>
            <td>URL which returns "EXPIRED" when the binary can be deleted.
            See <a href="expiration.html">Expiration</a> for details on the
            expiration workflow.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    
    <h2>Types</h2>
    <p>Currently valid types are:</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>IMAGE</dt>
        <dt>MOVIE</dt>
        <dt>XML</dt>
        <dd>XML document has to be well-formed to be accepted when this type is specified.</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <h2>Rendition overwriting</h2>
    <p>By uploading a file "File_RENDITION" where "RENDITION" is any valid
    rendition for the given bucket, the client can overwrite the calculation
    of a given rendition.</p>
    
    <h2>Response</h2>
    <p>HTTP Code 201 is returned on success, a normal
    <a href="errors.html">error response</a> otherwise. The response
    <tt>X-Asset</tt> header contains the path to the created asset file.
    Additionally the response body contains the following XML document:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;saved&gt;
    &lt;asset&gt;(asset file)&lt;/asset&gt;
&lt;/saved&gt;</code></pre>

    <p>Where "(asset file)" also points to the created asset file.</p>
    
    <h3>Warning</h3>
    <p>Do not implement the path naming logic in your client as the Binary
    Pool is free to change this at any time. If you absolutely must access
    content by it's SHA1 hash, use the <a href="cmd_get_sha1.html">get asset
    by SHA1 hash command</a>.</p>
