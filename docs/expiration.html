    <h1>Expiration</h1>
    
    <h2>Expiration rules</h2>
    <p>The binary pool has an expiration policy which works based on the
    notion of TTLs and callbacks.</p>
    
    <p>Each bucket defines a TTL which defines the expiry interval. Always
    after TTL days the binary is considered for deletion.</p>
        
    <p>A binary can have one or more callbacks provided by the clients
    (configured with the Callback parameter of the Create new binary command).
    These callbacks are an URL. When a binary is considered for deletions, the
    callback is executed. If all callbacks returns the exact string "EXPIRED"
    (case and spaces matter) the binary is deleted. Otherwise it's kept around
    for another TTL days.</p>
    
    <p>If the modification date is updated (Update modification date), the
    expiry date is incremented by TTL days. So the update modification date
    method effectively tells the binary pool that the client still cares.</p>
    
    <h2>Best practices</h2>
    <p>The easiest way to make sure binaries remain in the binary pool is to
    <a href="cmd_touch.html">touch them</a> periodically. Ideally you set up a
    daily or weekly cron job which goes through all the images which are still
    required and calls the touch command for those. In many architectures this
    is easier to implement than the callback.</p>
